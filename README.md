For our paper PASSION accepted by ACM MM-2024 Oral, please refer to

🧐  [ArXivPreprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14796) | [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jttrL7wHLC) | [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3664647.3681543) 

and this extension version HGA is used for submission.
The extension version based on our PASSION:
1. provide both 2D and 3D training code for MyoPS, MSSEG and BraTS datasets;
2. rethink the uni-modal and multi-modal combination wise co-learning problem; 
3. combine conflict-free meta learning with our preference-aware self-distillation;
4. work well with various backbones as well as modal-balancing methods;
